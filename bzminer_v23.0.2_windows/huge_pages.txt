Enable huge pages on windows:
1. From the Start menu, open Local Security Policy (under Administrative Tools).
2. Under Local Policies\User Rights Assignment, double click the Lock Pages in Memory setting.
3. Click Add User or Group and type your Windows user name.
4. Either log off and then log back in or restart your computer - unfortunately it won't work without this step.
